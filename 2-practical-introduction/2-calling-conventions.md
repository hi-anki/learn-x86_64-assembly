# Calling Conventions

Registers are fast, low-level storage locations in the CPU. While x86_64 offers 16 general-purpose registers, their usage is often guided by conventions rather than absolute freedom.

The use of these registers usually depends on the context. Primarily there exist two contexts:
  1. Function Call Context
  2. System Call Context

How registers would be used in the above two contexts is defined in a system-level agreement, called ABI, which stands for *Application Binary Interface*.

As long as we are out of these two contexts, we can use a register as we want. And we will demonstrate this later.

## General-Purpose Registers in x86_64

| Argument   | Register | Description      |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Syscall #  | `rax`    | Identifier       |
| Argument 1 | `rdi`    | First parameter  |
| Argument 2 | `rsi`    | Second parameter |
| Argument 3 | `rdx`    | Third parameter  |
| Argument 4 | `r10`    | Fourth parameter |
| Argument 5 | `r8`     | Fifth parameter  |
| Argument 6 | `r9`     | Sixth parameter  |

## Syscall Register Convention

| Register | Purpose / Convention                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `rax`    | Accumulator; return values, syscall # |
| `rbx`    | Base register; often callee-saved     |
| `rcx`    | Counter for loops, shifts             |
| `rdx`    | Data register; I/O, syscall args      |
| `rsi`    | Source index; memory ops, args        |
| `rdi`    | Destination index; memory ops, args   |
| `rbp`    | Base pointer; stack frame reference   |
| `rsp`    | Stack pointer; top of the stack       |
| `r8`     | 5th syscall argument                  |
| `r9`     | 6th syscall argument                  |
| `r10`    | 4th syscall argument                  |
| `r11`    | Temporary scratch for syscall         |
| `r12`â€“`r15` | Callee-saved; general-purpose      |

In Linux (x86_64), the most common calling convention is **System V AMD64 ABI**. It defines how functions and system calls exchange data by assigning specific roles to specific registers.

To successfully invoke a system call, our data must be placed in these registers accordingly. Otherwise, the kernel will not interpret our request correctly.

## But Why Do These Conventions Even Exist?

System V ABI (where V is 5) is not the only ABI that exist. It is the one that Linux uses. Microsoft Windows 64-bit uses x64 ABI.

If every organization used their own calling convention, one thing is sure to suffer, which is, cross-compatibility. These ABIs are contracts that everyone agrees upon. When every system uses the same convention, cross-compatibility increased. Software support increased.
