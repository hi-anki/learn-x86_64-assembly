# The Assembly Mindset

1. Assembly is not a high-level language, therefore, the usual mental models of learning a programming language are not going to help us.

2. Almost anything in a high-level programming language is an abstraction. Even C is not spared of it.

3. To sustain this journey, curiosity and the urge to find things out is paramount.

4. Context and Interpretation are the two things that rule assembly. DON'T TAKE THEM LIGHTLY!
   - As long as you remember these things, you will save yourself a lot frustration.
   - Most of the time, the reason behind my frustration and agitation was simply that I wasn't complying with the rules, because I didn't knew what were the rules.
   - And, what are the rules? ***Context and Interpretation***.
   - We need not to dive into these right now, because it is not the right time and place. These will be introduced as required.

5. Assembly is bare-metal. It knows no bounds.
   - At one moment, your program might run perfectly. And the next moment, it might run into an issue.
   - Finding problems in assembly programs is a headache. Why?
     - There are no guardrails.
     - You do, you fail, you understand, you don't repeat. That's it.
   - The best way to learn assembly is to not assume that your code will run in first attempt. Nor you should be happy if it ran perfectly.
     - There are subtlities which can make your program run or break.

6. What seems obvious is not obvious here.

7. Your code is one step away from "undefined behavior" territory.
   - Just swapping two lines two times to make them come to their initital place could change the outcome of the program. And I am not joking.
   - Just writing a character and then backspacing it changes the outcome. And I am not joking.
   - Therefore, complying with conventions of assembly is very important, which we will learn as we will progress.

8. Progressive learning.
   - As long as you don't hurry and keep learning things progressively, you will live a happy life.
   - But, if you hurried, it is not going to end good. I have learned this the hard way.

9. Keep your composure calm. Keep your attitude calm. If you can't keep calm, either of the two things will happen:
   - You will leave.
   - You'll become more calm, more silent and more peaceful. Assembly will ground you.
   - I am way too silent now, in comparison to when I started. I have worked on myself for over 8 months, to make myself more calm and mindful. It did worked. But the amount of silence I have achieved in one-month of learning assembly is just unfathomable.
