# Reading Input From The User

## Why stdin goes in .bss and not in .data section?

`.bss` section is the place for uninitialisied data.

The allocation in .bss is zero-initialized at runtime. Why can't we just zero initialize the memory locations ourselves in the .data section only?

`.data` section holds static and global variables, which are already initialized. This directly affects the size of the binary.

When we allocate an array of size 100 bytes, zero-initialized in .data section, those 100 bytes are basically excess space, because they aren't used right away. We have to populate them before using.

Those 100 bytes could also have been allocated directly at runtime, reducing the size of the overall binary? This is the whole idea behind the existence of `.bss` and why stdin goes in `.bss` not `.data`.

## Reserve Space

`buffer` is a user-defined label which is reserving number of bytes for stdin.

`.skip` is a GAS directive used to reserve uninitialized space by skipping N-bytes.

## Setup Read Syscall

The accumulator (`rax`) is setu for read syscall, which is 0.

The file descriptor (`rdi`) is set to 0, which is for stdin.

Now we need the runtime address of the `buffer` label in the source index register (`rsi`). To obtain this, we use `lea` instruction, which stands for *load effective address*.

Set rdx with the number of bytes to read (arg 3).

Invoke the syscall and read from console.

----

With that in mind, read syscall would look like: `read(fd, buffer, bytes)`

## Displaying The Input

Setup rax for write syscall, 1.

Set the file descriptor to 1, for stdout.

Load the buffer to write from in rsi.

Set the number of bytes to write in rdx.
  - The question is, how we are going to know the length of our input?
  - Because 100 is the maximum number of bytes that can be read, not necessarily the bytes we have read in total.

### How to find the number of bytes being read?

If we open the man page for `read` syscall, we can find this signature:
```c
ssize_t read(int fd, void buf[.count], size_t count);
```
If you are still unsure, lets look at the `RETURN VALUE` section.
```
On success, the number of bytes read is returned (zero indicates end of file), and the file position is advanced by this number.
```

Now it is confirmed that the number of bytes read is returned, but where? As this is a C wrapper on the actual syscall!

If you go back to the calling convention [article](../2-practical-introduction/2-calling-conventions.md), you can find that `rax` is where the result of a syscall is returned.
  - We can also verify this by visiting the System V ABI documentation.
  - Visit this gitlab repo, [x86-64 psABI](https://gitlab.com/x86-psABIs/x86-64-ABI).
  - Search for "Download latest PDF" and open the link.
  - Check Appendix A, AMD64 Linux Kernel Conventions on page 146.
  - Point number 5 reads as: *Returning from the syscall, register %rax contains the result of the system-call. A value in the range between -4095 and -1 indicates an error, it is -errno*

That's why we are setting up rdx before setting the accumulator for write syscall.

Invoke the syscall, print to console.

Exit syscall. And we are done.

## What is `lea` and Why is `lea`?

It stands for "load effective address".

It computes the address of a memory operand and loads it into a register, but it never access the value at that memory address.

Why we haven't used `offset`? 
  - Remeber assembly-time v/s runtime constraints? That's the reason.
  - `offset` is an assembler directive. It replaces the label with a virtual address or offset. It doesn't resemble the actual runtime address of that label (symbol).
  - `lea` is a CPU instruction which specializes in finding the runtime memory address of a label.

Lets talk about an undefined behavior here.
  - Right now we don't know how memory is managed, so we don't know what an offset, virtual address or anything else actually mean.
  - Sometimes, just using `offset` with mov can perfectly work. But, its not guaranteed.
  - This undefined behavior exists when that offset or virtual address is mapped as it is in the actual memory, which in todays world is almost impossible if you use production-grade principles.
  - ASLR exists to eliminate such possibilities. ASLR stands for address space layout randomization. But we need not to know about it.
  - Just keep this in mind that `offset` might work but it is not right.
